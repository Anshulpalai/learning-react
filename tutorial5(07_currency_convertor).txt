Project - Currency convertor

Create the app using vite. Then install and intialize tailwindcss in it.

## Creating first custom hook, using two other hooks such as useState and useEffect.
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

function useCurrencyInfo(currency) {
    """" Using an API to fetch the data of the conversion rates of the currency """"

    let url = `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/fawazahmed0/currency-api@1/latest/currencies/${currency}.json`;
    
    ### useEffect is very useful because when there is some change in the dependencies provided below then re-run the function call provided in the callback of it. ###
    useEffect(()=>{
        fetch(url).then((res)=>{
            res.json();
        }).then((e)=>{})
    }, [])
}
